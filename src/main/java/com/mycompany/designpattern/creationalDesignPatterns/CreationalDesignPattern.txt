Creational design patterns in Spring Boot help manage object creation and provide flexibility and reuse of code. Here are some common creational design patterns used in Spring Boot:

1. Singleton Pattern
By default, Spring beans are singletons. This means that Spring creates only one instance of a bean per Spring container, which is reused throughout the application.


@Service
public class MyService {
    // Singleton Service Bean
}
2. Factory Pattern
Spring’s @Bean methods often act as factory methods, which create and configure objects.


@Configuration
public class MyConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
3. Prototype Pattern
The prototype pattern is used when you want multiple instances of a bean. You can define a bean with prototype scope in Spring.


@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class PrototypeBean {
    // Prototype Bean
}
4. Builder Pattern
The builder pattern is used for constructing complex objects step by step. Spring Boot’s configuration classes often use this pattern to build objects with complex state.


@Configuration
public class DataSourceConfig {
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create()
                                 .url("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb")
                                 .username("user")
                                 .password("password")
                                 .build();
    }
}
5. Dependency Injection (DI)
Dependency Injection is a fundamental design pattern in Spring. It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class in different ways.


@Component
public class MyComponent {
    private final MyService myService;

    @Autowired
    public MyComponent(MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService;
    }
}
6. Abstract Factory Pattern
Spring’s FactoryBean interface provides an abstract factory for creating objects. It allows for creating instances of complex objects that require custom instantiation logic.


@Component
public class MyFactoryBean implements FactoryBean<MyBean> {
    @Override
    public MyBean getObject() throws Exception {
        return new MyBean();
    }

    @Override
    public Class<?> getObjectType() {
        return MyBean.class;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSingleton() {
        return true; // or false for prototype
    }
}
These patterns simplify the process of object creation, configuration, and management in Spring Boot applications, making your code more maintainable and scalable.
