/* 
   Thrown when an application attempts to use null in a case where an object is required. These include:

	1. Invoking a method from a null object.
	2. Accessing or modifying a null objectï¿½s field.
	3. Taking the length of null, as if it were an array.
	4. Accessing or modifying the slots of null object, as if it were an array.
	5. Throwing null, as if it were a Throwable value.
	6. When you try to synchronize over a null object.

	Why do we need the null value? 
	- It is mainly used to indicate that no value is assigned to a reference variable.
